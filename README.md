# domain-authority-checker
A php script to find the domain authority
## **GitHub README File for PHP Domain Authority Finder**

### **Introduction**
This PHP script leverages the Moz API to determine the Domain Authority (DA) of a specified website. Domain Authority is a metric developed by Moz that estimates how well a website will rank in search engine results.

If you don't know what is Domain authority check out [What is domain authority?](https://apptraitsolutions.com/what-is-domain-authority-and-how-to-increase-it/).

### **Prerequisites**
Before using the script, ensure you have the following:
* A PHP development environment with cURL enabled.
* A Moz API key.

### **Getting a Moz API Key**
1. Visit the Moz API documentation: [https://moz.com/help/links-api](https://moz.com/help/links-api)
2. Create a free Moz account or log in to your existing account.
3. Navigate to the API section and follow the instructions to generate an API key.

### **Installation**
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dipen-apptrait/domain-authority-checker.git
   ```

### **Usage**
1. **Set your API key:**
   * Open the `index.php` file.
   * Replace `YOUR_MOZ_API_KEY` with your actual Moz API key.

2. **Run the script:**
   * From your terminal, navigate to the project directory.
   * Execute the script:
     ```bash
     php domain_authority.php
     ```
   * You will be prompted to enter the domain you want to check.

### **Example Output**
```
Enter the domain: apptraitsolutions.com
Domain Authority: 45
```

### **Customization**
You can customize the script further by:
* Adding error handling to handle API rate limits or other exceptions.
* Implementing caching to improve performance for frequently checked domains.
* Integrating with a web application or command-line interface.

### **Additional Notes**
* **API Usage Limits:** Be mindful of the Moz API's rate limits to avoid exceeding your usage quota.
* **Data Accuracy:** While Domain Authority is a valuable metric, it's important to consider other factors when evaluating a website's overall SEO performance.
